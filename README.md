# API Testing

This is for a code test.

## Usage

Run the `api-testing.py` script (written in Python 3.10.5, but should work for most varieties of Python 3), then open the `report.html` page in the browser of your choice.

## Files

* The `oracles/oracle.json` contains the "correct" result for the user list/single user API call tests.
* The `api-testing.py` script gets the data from the APIs and writes the results to file; it uses the `requests` package.
* `LICENSE` and `README.md` are, well, the license (MIT) and readme (you're reading it) files.
* `report.html` is the template file for the test report.
* The `results.js` file is generated by the Python script, and would normally not be included in the repository.
* `script.js` wrangles the results into a legible format.
* And finally `style.css` helps display the results.
